# StringBits Docker Infrastructure Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the StringBits Docker infrastructure, its components, monitoring systems, and maintenance procedures.

## Infrastructure Components

The StringBits Docker infrastructure consists of the following components:

### Core Services

1. **Caddy**: Reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS
   - Routes traffic to appropriate services based on domain
   - Manages SSL certificates automatically
   - Implements security headers and best practices

2. **Portainer**: Container management UI
   - Accessible at ptn.stringbits.com (restricted via Tailscale)
   - Manages all Docker containers and stacks
   - Provides a web interface for Docker management

3. **n8n**: Workflow automation platform
   - Accessible at n8n.stringbits.com
   - Requires authentication
   - Used for automating business processes

4. **WordPress**: Content management system
   - Accessible at wp.stringbits.com
   - Connected to MySQL database
   - Manages website content

5. **Watchtower**: Automatic container updates
   - Checks for updates every 5 minutes
   - Only updates containers with specific label
   - Ensures infrastructure stays up-to-date

### Additional Services

1. **RustDesk**: Remote desktop solution
   - Accessible at rd.stringbits.com
   - HBBS and HBBR components for connection handling
   - Secure remote access to systems

2. **Git Daemon**: Git repository server
   - Internal service for configuration management
   - Stores Portainer stack definitions
   - Provides version control for configurations

## Monitoring and Validation System

The infrastructure includes a comprehensive monitoring and validation system:

### Key Components

1. **Enhanced Monitor**: Automated health checks
   - Runs every 15 minutes via cron
   - Checks container status, endpoint availability, resources
   - Sends notifications through multiple channels when issues detected

2. **Validation System**: Configuration validation
   - Daily validation of all system components
   - Checks Docker Compose files, networks, container health
   - Generates HTML reports of validation results

3. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing
   - Weekly execution of all tests
   - End-to-end tests of all services and endpoints
   - Produces detailed HTML test reports

4. **Notification System**: Multiple notification channels
   - Email: Primary notification channel via SSMTP
   - Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram: Optional additional channels
   - HTML-formatted detailed reports

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance

1. **Daily**:
   - Automated monitoring runs every 15 minutes
   - Validation checks run daily at 3 AM
   - Logs are automatically collected and retained

2. **Weekly**:
   - Comprehensive tests run every Sunday at 4 AM
   - Test reports are generated for review
   - Container updates via Watchtower

3. **Monthly**:
   - Manual review of all validation and test reports
   - Cleanup of old logs and temporary files
   - Review of security configurations

4. **As Needed**:
   - Update Docker Compose files for new services
   - Adjust monitoring thresholds and notifications
   - Update documentation for new components

### Backup Procedures

1. **Configuration Backups**:
   - All configurations are stored in Git repositories
   - Regular backups to GitHub repositories
   - Version control for all configuration changes

2. **Data Backups**:
   - Docker volumes for persistent data
   - WordPress content and database backups
   - n8n workflow backups

## Security Considerations

1. **Network Security**:
   - Private Docker network for all services
   - Restricted access to management interfaces
   - Tailscale for secure remote access

2. **HTTPS and Encryption**:
   - Automatic HTTPS via Caddy for all services
   - Modern TLS configurations
   - Security headers implementation

3. **Authentication**:
   - Basic authentication for n8n
   - WordPress login security
   - Portainer access control

4. **Container Security**:
   - No-new-privileges flag for all containers
   - Regular updates via Watchtower
   - Resource limits and constraints

## Improvements and Enhancements

The following improvements have been implemented to enhance the infrastructure:

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Multi-channel notifications (Email, Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram)
   - Detailed health checks for all services
   - Metrics collection for trend analysis
   - HTML-formatted detailed alerts

2. **Comprehensive Validation**:
   - Configuration validation for all components
   - Network validation and connectivity testing
   - Security header verification
   - Portainer stack validation

3. **Testing Automation**:
   - End-to-end tests for all services
   - Automated weekly testing
   - HTML test reports with detailed results
   - Integration with monitoring system

4. **Documentation**:
   - Detailed documentation for all components
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Configuration management documentation
   - Maintenance procedures

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Security headers implementation
   - HTTPS configuration validation
   - Authentication verification
   - Regular security testing

## Conclusion

The StringBits Docker infrastructure is a robust, well-monitored system with comprehensive validation, testing, and notification capabilities. Regular maintenance procedures ensure system reliability and security, while detailed documentation provides guidance for ongoing management and troubleshooting.
