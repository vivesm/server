# Security Review Report
Generated: 2025-01-26

## Executive Summary

Overall security posture: **MODERATE** with critical issues requiring immediate attention.

### Critical Issues Found:
1. **UFW Firewall is DISABLED** - Major security risk
2. **Default credentials on n8n** (admin/changeme)
3. **n8n exposed on all interfaces** (0.0.0.0:5678)
4. **No rate limiting** on exposed services
5. **SSH open on all interfaces** (0.0.0.0:22)

## Detailed Security Analysis

### 1. Tailscale Access Restrictions ✅ PARTIALLY SECURE

**Findings:**
- Portainer correctly bound to Tailscale IP (100.112.235.46:9443) and localhost
- Caddy configured with Tailscale IP filtering for sensitive services
- iptables DOCKER-USER rules block non-Tailscale access to ports 9443, 8000

**Issues:**
- Security documentation references outdated Tailscale IP (100.84.182.31)
- MCP services configuration prepared but not actively running

### 2. Exposed Ports Audit ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION

**Public Exposed Ports:**
```
0.0.0.0:22    - SSH (HIGH RISK)
0.0.0.0:80    - HTTP (Caddy)
0.0.0.0:443   - HTTPS (Caddy) 
0.0.0.0:5678  - n8n web UI (CRITICAL)
```

**Tailscale-Only Ports:**
```
100.112.235.46:9443 - Portainer (SECURE)
127.0.0.1:9443      - Portainer localhost (SECURE)
```

### 3. Docker Security ✅ GOOD

**Positive findings:**
- All containers use `no-new-privileges:true`
- No containers running as privileged
- Containers not using host network mode
- Proper volume mounting practices

**Recommendations:**
- Consider using read-only root filesystem where possible
- Implement resource limits (CPU/memory)

### 4. HTTPS & Security Headers ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Caddy Configuration:**
- Automatic HTTPS enabled
- Security headers defined in Caddyfile template
- Headers include: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.
- **Note**: CSP intentionally removed from WordPress site for compatibility

**WordPress CSP Exception:**
- Content Security Policy disabled for wp.stringbits.com
- Required for WordPress themes and plugins to function properly
- WordPress dynamically injects inline scripts and styles
- Documented in `/docker-stack-infrastructure/caddy/config/Caddyfile`

**Issues:**
- Unable to verify headers are being applied to all services
- n8n directly exposed on HTTP (port 5678)

### 5. Authentication & Secrets ❌ CRITICAL

**Major Issues:**
- **n8n using default credentials** (admin/changeme)
- Portainer password file owned by root (good) but in project directory
- Secrets exposed in container environment variables

**Positive:**
- Portainer password file has proper permissions (600)

### 6. Firewall & Network Isolation ❌ CRITICAL

**Major Issue: UFW is DISABLED**
```
Status: inactive
```

**Network Security:**
- iptables DOCKER-USER rules provide some protection
- Docker networks properly configured (stringbits_net, docker_stringbits_net)
- But no host-level firewall protection

## Security Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Critical):

1. **Enable UFW Firewall**
```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow from 100.64.0.0/10 to any port 22
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw --force enable
```

2. **Secure n8n**
```bash
# Remove public exposure - bind only to Docker network
# Update docker-compose to remove port mapping 0.0.0.0:5678
# Access only through Caddy reverse proxy
```

3. **Change n8n Default Password**
- Update N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD in docker-compose
- Use strong, unique password
- Consider using Docker secrets

4. **Restrict SSH to Tailscale**
```bash
# Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
ListenAddress 100.112.235.46
# Restart SSH
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### SHORT-TERM (Within 1 week):

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting to Caddy configuration
   - Protect against brute force attacks

2. **Enable Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Configure fail2ban for SSH
   - Set up log aggregation
   - Alert on suspicious activities

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Move all secrets to Docker secrets
   - Remove environment variable passwords
   - Use external secret management

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Fix incorrect Tailscale IPs in SECURITY.md
   - Document all security measures

5. **WordPress Security Hardening**
   - Keep WordPress core, themes, and plugins updated
   - Use application passwords for API access only
   - Implement WordPress-specific security plugins
   - Regular security audits to compensate for CSP removal

### MEDIUM-TERM (Within 1 month):

1. **Network Segmentation**
   - Create separate networks for public/private services
   - Implement zero-trust network architecture

2. **Security Scanning**
   - Regular vulnerability scanning
   - Container image scanning
   - Dependency updates

3. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Encrypted backups
   - Test recovery procedures
   - Offsite backup storage

## Compliance Checklist

- [ ] All services behind HTTPS
- [ ] Strong authentication on all services
- [ ] Firewall enabled and configured
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] Regular security reviews

## Conclusion

While the infrastructure has good Docker security practices and Tailscale integration, critical gaps exist in basic security hygiene. The disabled firewall and default credentials pose immediate risks that must be addressed before this system can be considered production-ready.

Priority should be given to enabling the firewall, changing default credentials, and restricting service exposure to only what's necessary.
