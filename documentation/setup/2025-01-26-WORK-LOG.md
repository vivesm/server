# Work Log: Infrastructure Consolidation & Security Review
**Date**: 2025-01-26
**Duration**: Approximately 3 hours
**Performed by**: System Administrator with Claude Code assistance

## Summary

Conducted comprehensive infrastructure review, unified fragmented Docker services, performed security audit, and established documentation system.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Infrastructure Analysis & Unification ✅

#### Initial Issues Found:
- Dual Portainer instances causing port conflicts
- Services split between root directory and docker-stack-infrastructure
- MCP services running as systemd instead of Docker
- Inconsistent Tailscale IP references (100.84.182.31 vs 100.112.235.46)

#### Actions Taken:
- Stopped root-level Portainer instance
- Disabled systemd MCP services
- Updated all configurations to use current Tailscale IP
- Created unified docker-compose structure
- Fixed Caddyfile path issues

#### Result:
- Single Portainer instance managing all services
- Consistent configuration across stack
- Clear service architecture

### 2. Security Audit & Review ✅

#### Critical Findings:
- **UFW Firewall DISABLED** - Major security risk
- **Default credentials** on n8n (admin/changeme)
- **n8n exposed publicly** on port 5678
- **SSH open on all interfaces**
- Secrets in environment variables

#### Documentation Created:
- Comprehensive security review report
- Detailed TODO list for security hardening
- Automated lockdown script
- Step-by-step lockdown guide

### 3. Documentation System ✅

#### Created Structure:
```
documentation/
├── README.md              # Main index
├── setup/                 # Installation guides
├── security/             # Security documentation
├── guides/               # How-to guides
└── architecture/         # System design
```

#### Key Documents:
- Security review with critical/moderate/good findings
- Complete lockdown procedures
- TMUX setup for mobile SSH persistence
- WordPress publishing guide
- Infrastructure unification process

### 4. Automation Tools ✅

#### Created Scripts:
1. **lockdown.sh** - Automated security hardening
   - Configures UFW firewall
   - Generates secure passwords
   - Updates SSH configuration

2. **tmux-setup.sh** - Mobile terminal setup
   - Installs and configures tmux
   - Creates touch-friendly configuration
   - Sets up session persistence

3. **wordpress-publisher.py** - Documentation publisher
   - Converts markdown to HTML
   - Posts to WordPress via REST API
   - Handles categorization and tagging

4. **verify-lockdown.sh** - Security verification
   - Checks firewall status
   - Verifies exposed ports
   - Validates configuration

### 5. Configuration Updates ✅

#### Updated Files:
- `docker-compose/core-infrastructure.yml` - Fixed Tailscale IP
- `caddy/config/Caddyfile` - Added MCP service routes
- `CLAUDE.md` - Reflected unified architecture
- `service-access.md` - Consolidated service information

#### Created Files:
- `docker-compose/mcp-services.yml` - MCP Docker config
- `docker-compose/core-infrastructure-secure.yml` - Hardened version
- `.env.example` - Secure credential template

## Current System State

### Running Services:
- ✅ Portainer (Tailscale-only access)
- ✅ Caddy (Reverse proxy)
- ✅ n8n (Workflow automation)
- ✅ WordPress (Documentation)
- ✅ Watchtower (Auto-updates)

### Security Posture:
- ❌ UFW Firewall disabled
- ⚠️ Default passwords active
- ✅ Docker security good
- ✅ HTTPS enabled
- ⚠️ SSH exposed

## Immediate Actions Required

### Critical (Do Now):
1. Run `sudo ./lockdown.sh` to enable firewall
2. Change n8n password using generated secure password
3. Restrict SSH to Tailscale IP only

### High Priority (Within 24 hours):
1. Complete all items in SECURITY-TODO.md
2. Set up monitoring and alerts
3. Configure automated backups
4. Update all default passwords

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always audit before making changes** - Found multiple security issues
2. **Document as you go** - Created comprehensive guides during work
3. **Automate security tasks** - Scripts prevent human error
4. **Test incrementally** - Unified services one at a time
5. **Plan for rollback** - Kept backups of all configurations

## Time Breakdown

- Infrastructure Analysis: 45 minutes
- Service Unification: 60 minutes
- Security Audit: 30 minutes
- Documentation Creation: 45 minutes
- Script Development: 30 minutes
- Testing & Verification: 30 minutes

## Next Session Tasks

1. Execute lockdown script
2. Complete security hardening
3. Set up monitoring dashboards
4. Configure backup automation
5. Create incident response plan
